            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Sarah Paterson, an artist, graphic designer, and aspiring computer programer. Though that may seem contrary, I fundamentally am a problem solver. Whether it is solving a problem in the composition of a painting, the communication through a logo design, or the code of a program, I find joy in solving problems.<br><br>I live in the wonderful state of Colorado where I was born and raised with my husband and my cat. The emoji above is one I made of our cat, Skipper. For the past five years, however, I lived in the sunshine of central Florida. Ultimately, the mountain's call became too great, so we had to return. I currently work as a painter and am working towards becoming a computer programer!</p>
